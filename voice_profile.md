## Sample Posts

### Example 1 — Pain Point
```
Annual budget season just ended.
The plan is already outdated.

Every January, finance teams finish months of budgeting work. Assumptions locked in October. Targets set in November. Final sign-off in December.

Then reality hits in February. The annual plan built on Q4 assumptions doesn't reflect Q1 reality.

The problem isn't the team. It's the model.
```

### Example 2 — Case Study Reference
```
When I rescued a failed planning implementation for a UK biotech, the previous build had zero user adoption.

I rebuilt from scratch around how the team actually worked.

Result: 60+ active users. FP&A cycle dropped from a week to a day.
```
